# HokBot

A discord bot that checks if the office of Study Association Syntaxis is open.




## Deployment

Add the bot to a Discord server and then rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`.
Add the neccessary information in the tags in the newly renamed `config.json`.

Node.js needs to be installed for this to work.

To deploy this project, first install all dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

Then run the script to register all commands:
```bash
  npm run refresh
```

Finally run the bot by executing:
```bash
  npm run runBot
```
